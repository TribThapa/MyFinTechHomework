# INSURTECH *CoverGenius*

## Overview and origin

[**CoverGenius**](https://www.covergenius.com/) is a global insurance technology company with offices in New York, San Francisco, London, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Sydney. Their vision is to protect all customers of the world's largest online companies. *CoverGenius* was founded by _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ in 2014, when it launched its first 'full stack' insurance distribution platform for mobility, retail, travel, and share-economy partners in Europe. 

*CoverGenius* came about when _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ had the vision of empowering the world's largest e-commerce companies to sell insurance products. This idea initially stemmed from _Chris Bayley_ who previoulsy ran the insurance team at Google. There he saw commerical opportunities for selling insurance online but felt he lacked the right model. Subsequently, they found an opportunity with a sizeable niche that was currenlty being overlooked - Car Rental Insurance. Then, the Car Rental Insurance industry was worth US $7 billion globally, of which US $6 billion was profit. 

To test the waters, _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ engaged global insurers to provide car rental policies for their clients. However, they noticed the inability to provide capacity in short time frames and the archaic processes that got in the way. As a result, _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ took it upon themselves to esablish a company that provided insurance in this space.   

When establishing the company, *Cover Genius* was not VC funded and the small rounds were funded by London-based insurance executives including _Jim Sutcliffe_, former Chair of Sun Life Canada and _Julian Roberts_, former CEO of Old Mutual.

## Business activities
*CoverGenius* aims fill the void of a global insurer that sells insurance policies to customers all over the world. They achieve this goal by allowing e-commericial platforms to offer insurance policies to their customers through *CoverGenius'* [_XCover_](https://www.covergenius.com/xcover/) and [_XClaim_](https://www.covergenius.com/xclaim/) platforms. XCover uses 'RESTful' API to optimise price and products in real-time for customers in 60 coutnries and 50 US states while XClaim uses another API (called XClaim) to make instant payments in any form e.g., store credits, bank transfer, or to digital wallets.

The company's intended customers are those that use e-commercial platforms from all over the globe. Some of their partners in the e-commerical space include *eBay*, *Shopee*, *IcelandAir*, *OLA*, and *ShipStation*. Currently, there is no information about the market size of their set of customers. However, with growing use of e-commercial platforms and e-businesses, *CoverGenius* aims to tap into e-markets all over the world.

Despite several webpages comparing *CoverGenius* to other FinTech companies, _Chris Bayley_ claims their main competitors remain the traditional insurers who lack the digital platform and the effeciency that comes with it.

### A cornerstone to *CoverGenius'* success is its technology, which incldues:
- _Brightwrite:_ a data analytics platform that recommends product bundles and optimizes price for any *CoverGenius* customer. 
- _API:_ used for seamless policy recommendation tailored to the customer and to ensure instant payments in any currency.
- _HTML5_, _Google Analytics_, _jQuery_: used in APIs to access large amounts of data so recommended polcies are tailored to the customer.
- _SPF_: stands for 'Sender Policy Framework' which is a email verification technology used to prevent email spoofing. It works by verifying that an email message is sent from an authorised IP address.
- _SSL_: stands for 'Secure Sockets Layer' which is a protocol developed for sending information securely over the internet. Many websites use SSL to secure areas of their sites, such as user account pages and online checkout.


## Landscape

### Major trends and innovations over the last 5 to 10 years seen in the Insurtech space

#### 1. Digitise or die
    - Major trends to use APIs and or microservices architecture to work around transactional legacy systems but also allow interconnectivity with many other systems.
    - Robotic Process Automation deployed to offer better customer interaction and data harvesting.
    - Increased investment in customer-facing digital platforms, intelligent automation to streamline processes, and smart contracts for claims and predicitive underwriting.

#### 2. Rocking ecosystem 
    - Biometric security has been adopted to make micropayments simple. The quicker and easier the transaction, the more loyal the customer.
    - Efficient management of millions of micropayments have allowed insurtech companies like Zhong An in China to thrive.
    - One-stop-shop with a multi-faceted experience determines winners and losers (e.g., Tencent is a platform that combines payment, social media, and contextual messaging(WeChat)). This platform generates 38 billion messages everyday, producing a rich source of data to feedback to insurers' analytics engines.  

#### 3. The reset button 
    - Reduced dependence on legacy systems with improved access to data.
    - Changed focus from manufacturing, selling, and marketing of products to keeping the customer satisfied.
    - New systems segment customers based upon behaviour and how they interact with the insurer and influence risk within the policy.
  
#### 4. Digital risk reduction
    - Data from wearables are now being used as a source of risk assessment, risk mitigation, and data credibility.
    - Use of health data has allowed insurtech companies to tailor policies to the individual and take part in a health ecosystem.

#### 5. The digital customer
    - More focus on digital content marketing as today's customers have moved to increased do not call lists, and are more engaged with messaging.
    - Products that offer break periods or the ability to post-pone payment without the policy being cancelled are features that could widen the customer base.
    - Interaction with customers has moved from policy anniversaries and renewal periods to a needs-basis.

#### 6. Data is the new oil - and the price is going up! 
    - While big data influences customer engagement and policy making, insurtech comapnies are now working to improve customer trust.
    - Insurtech companies that lack big data or the partners that will help them analyse the data are having their business model challenged.
    - AI and Machine learning have now been adopted across the value chain to improve efficiency and increase customer satisfaction.
    - Traditional categories of age, sex, location, ethnicity, etc are obsolete as customers are increasingly segmented based upon behaviour dervied from rich datasets.

#### 7. Disruption 
    - Mobility as a service (MAAS), where a car use is consumed as a service is growing in many metropolitan areas.
    - Insurers hint at a profitable auto insurance business is not a race to the bottom but rather by developing an auto insurance ecosystem that starts at the car's dashboard.
    - Auto makers may take control of this value chain and needs to be considered when adopting this business model.

#### 8. Adapt or die
    - Underwriters and actuaries with data science skills armed with a treasury of customer behaviour data, AI, and Machine learning now lead the charge in reassessing and enhancing the statistical approach to traditional underwriting.
    - While the main focus is on the customer, Insurtech companies are now also trying to educate and enhance the experience of the employee to retain skills for the new market.


## Recommendations
- *CoverGenius* will need to promote the use of frictionless money (i.e., reduced transcation cost) to be appealing to customers outside of its main markets. Especially, for customers in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East where transcation fees are high.
- To further their customer base, *CoverGenius* will need to think about potential customers withouth bank accounts. While digital transformation is central to the company's growth, it is also important to ensure those with limited access or from under-priviledged countries/cities/areas are not forgotten.
- Perhaps, a cashback rewards program similar to those used by many banks and e-commerce platforms can help finance accessing customers with no bank accounts.
- As the business grows, *CoverGenius* will need to consider complementing indemnity of risk by risk prevention. An avenue worth exploring for market expansion and business scalabity.
- Cryptocurrency is here to stay. While it is a volatile asset class, *CoverGenius* will need to consider including cryptocurrency in their current pricing model to access an untapped market. 
- The adoption of cryptocurrency may also help ease pain points seen with Fiat currency. Specially, in nations where their local currency is devalued or in countries where citizens want to avoid control from a central bank.
- Further, the adoption of cryptocurrency, implies use of blockchain technology which can be used to safeguard customer data, recommend efficient insurance policies underwritten by smart contracts, and help build customer trust. Specially, in today's world where customer's are hesitant to share data for invasion of privacy.
- Blockchain technology and machine learning can also be used to detect fraud and insure payments and policies are tamper-proof. 
- While *CoverGenius* personalises insurance policies to the individual based upon behavioural data collected via APIs, this approach can be taken a step further where customers build credit to discount future policies. E.g., by using wearbles that measure heart rate, respiratory rate, and step count. These data suggest reduced risk for the insurer and reward programs can be built around such information to build customer relationship and loyalty.
