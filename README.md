## My name is Tribikram Thapa (Rana) 

### I have a background in Physiotherapy, and currently work as a Research Fellow at Monash University

I aim to transition into finance with the hope of using blockchain technology in the banking sector. 

I chose FinTech as a course because it combines my passion in programming and finance.
