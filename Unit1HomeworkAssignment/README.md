# INSURTECH *CoverGenius*

## Overview and origin

*CoverGenius* is a global insurance technology company with offices in New York, San Francisco, London, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Sydney. Their vision is to protect all customers of the world's largest online companies. *CoverGenius* was founded by _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ in 2014, when it launched its first 'full stack' insurance distribution platform for mobility, retail, travel, and share-economy partners in Europe. 

*CoverGenius* came about when _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ had the vision of empowering the world's largest e-commerce companies to sell insurance products. This idea initially stemmed from _Chris Bayley_ who previoulsy ran the insurance team at Google. There he saw commerical opportunities for selling insurance online but felt he lacked the right model. Subsequently, they found an opportunity with a sizeable nice that was currenlty being overlooked - Car Rental Insurance. Then, the Car Rental Insurance industry was worth US $7 billion globally, of which US $6 billion was profit. 

To test the waters, _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ engaged global insurers to provide car rental policies for their clients. However, they noticed the inability to provide capacity in short time frames and the archaic processes that got in the way. As a result, _Chris Bayley_ and _Angus McDonald_ took it upon themselves to esablish a company the provided insurance in this space.   


Cover Genius was not VC funded and the small rounds were been funded by London-based insurance executives including Jim Sutcliffe, former Chair of Sun Life Canada and Julian Roberts, former CEO of Old Mutual.
