It imposed daily and weekly purchase\\n  limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets\\n  and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of\\n  total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This\\n  will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the\\n  world\\'s fourth largest producer, undermining the market.\\n      The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer\\n  Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.\\n      A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was\\n  adopted earlier this month in Geneva.

It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during\\n  the two years.\\n      \"We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the\\n  industrialisation began,\" official Xu said. \"Since then, nearly\\n  all the families in the county have built new homes and many\\n  factories have gone up.\"\\n      \"Last year we lost land to a new railway line,\" Xu said. But\\n  land losses in future should fall because nearly all families\\n  already have new houses, she added.\\n      The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the\\n  Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that\\n  China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land\\n  for the first time this year.\\n      \"The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,\\n  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,\" said\\n  an article in the official press explaining the new measures.\\n      \"It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,\" it\\n  said. \"China has a large population and its land resources are\\n  badly deficient.\"\\n      An official of the Shanghai city government said county\\n  authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of\\n  arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must\\n  be approved by the city government.\\n     The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its\\n  efforts to ensure China\\'s people get enough grain to eat. The\\n  prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making\\n  it more profitable for them to grow other crops.\\n      To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser\\n  and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to\\n  buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to\\n  China\\'s 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise\\n  grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.\\n      Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the\\n  problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.\\n      Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the\\n  eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too\\n  much to the demands of \"selfish city people\" and could raise city\\n  grain prices without any problem.\\n      But the government has ruled out a price rise. \"Raising the\\n  price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social\\n  stability,\" said a China Daily editorial this month.\\n      The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the\\n  long term. \"We must be very careful. We have a very large\\n  population which is used to price stability and will object to\\n  price rises,\" he said. \"The problem is how to do it.\"\\n      The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might\\n  also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with\\n  grain and consumed by city residents.\\n      In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate\\n  investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.\\n      The official press has reported that farmers fear farm\\n  policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into\\n  building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.\\n      Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign\\n  contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,\\n  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.\\n      \"As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at\\n  the halfway mark, farmers are beginning to worry about the\\n  future,\" the China Daily said in an editorial last month.\\n      Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to\\n  use the land but not own it. For most of the period of\\n  Communist rule, the land was organised into collectives where\\n  there was little room for individual initiative.\\n      \"New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency\\n  of government policies and make them interested in long-term\\n  investment,\" the newspaper said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Some\\n  10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to\\n  more profitable crops such as oilseeds.\\n      The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the\\n  current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha\\n  over the next five to seven years, he said.\\n      Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is\\n  just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln\\n  tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year\\'s\\n  yield of 14.0 mln.\\n      He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more\\n  recent rains reduced prospects slightly.\\n      The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln\\n  tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan\\'s annual\\n  population growth rate of more than three pct. Current\\n  consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.\\n      The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.\\n  This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln\\n  tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a\\n  \"strategic reserve\" target of two mln tonnes.\\n      Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over\\n  target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.\\n      The government wants to keep an extra \"safety margin\" until\\n  it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat\\n  rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports\\n  will be considered only in about a year\\'s time when the 1987/88\\n  crop can be gauged as well, he said.\\n      The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the\\n  government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two\\n  rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in\\n  Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.\\n      Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and\\n  due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were\\n  issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.\\n      Aziz said following the introduction of a government\\n  support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that\\n  only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the\\n  consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.\\n      The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect\\n  on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.\\n      Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of\\n  the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive\\n  Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March\\n  1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.\\n      Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a\\n  major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better\\n  use of side-products such as bran.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both.\"\\n      Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill\\n  for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman\\n  said that it will probably be introduced next week.\\n      Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to\\n  forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency\\n  payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --\\n  only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under\\n  the current bill.\\n      It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill,\\n  he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet\\n  budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than\\n  sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed.\\n      A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a\\n  different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said.\\n      Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government\\n  payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this\\n  point, he said.\\n      \"I don\\'t think there is any interest in pursuing a\\n  decoupling bill this year.

The payments would\\n  cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.\\n      The administration sugar proposal is expected to be\\n  introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.\\n  John Porter, R-Ill.\\n      Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it\\n  is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because\\n  politically-influential sugar and corn growers\\n  and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.\\n      The direct payment plan outlined by the administration \\n  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually\\n  lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment\\n  any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.\\n      For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower\\n  would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3\\n  cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.\\n      The income payments would be based on the amount of\\n  commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985\\n  or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.\\n      Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes\\n  in the sugar program because the current high price support is\\n  causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.\\n      He said the current program has artificially stimulated\\n  domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed\\n  corn sweeteners to make market inroads.\\n      U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a\\n  \"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one\\n  mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar\\n  refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.\\n      Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives\\n  overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a\\n  competitive advantage.

(Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of\\n  doing business.\"\\n      \"We\\'re sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said.\\n  \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with.\\n  There are plenty of capable firms.\"\\n      Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing\\n  with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures\\n  through a Chicago-based cooperative.\\n      \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to\\n  individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but\\n  added, \"The times change and with changing times, come\\n  different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"\\n      Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had\\n  nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you\\n  that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy\\n  organization.\"\\n      In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois\\n  Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members\\'\\n  equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for\\n  the most recent year has not been filed.\\n      Under the cooperative system, income from operations is\\n  returned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.\\n      Income and refunds in the past five years have been\\n  declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op\\n  reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0\\n  mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28,\\n  1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.\\n      \"You\\'re dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan\\n  said. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"\\n      According to the company\\'s 1986 annual report, Growmark\\n  owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common\\n  shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.\\n      Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital\\n  Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the\\n  figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.\\n  Equity is distributed according to each member\\'s trading volume\\n  and, as a result, changes from year to year.\\n      However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet\\n  minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark\\n  pulled out.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Huckaby, chairman\\n  of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar\\n  issues, told Reuters in an interview.\\n      Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year\\n  they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the\\n  same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also\\n  said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.\\n      Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic\\n  sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further\\n  cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons.\\n      \"I think if we\\'re talking about dropping (the quota)\\n  another half mln tons, lets say, you\\'re getting to the point\\n  where the program might not work,\" he said.\\n      \"Ideally, I\\'d like to freeze things right where we are,\"\\n  said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.\\n      A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the\\n  current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the\\n  U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports\\n  holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said.\\n      A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made\\n  until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said.\\n      \"I feel like if we didn\\'t expand production, we could\\n  probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through\\n  the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),\"\\n  Huckaby said.\\n      However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup\\n  producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener\\n  market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said.\\n      He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will\\n  capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in\\n  the U.S.\\n      But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the\\n  production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further\\n  expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports\\n  might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.\\n      Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner\\n  companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.\\n      \"This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have\\n  some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the\\n  program is preserved,\" Huckaby said.\\n      Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to\\n  think about how domestic output could be controlled, either\\n  through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls.\\n      Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the\\n  Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask\\n  corn refiners to limit production.\\n      \"I don\\'t know if we will go this route, but if we do\\n  there\\'s a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do\\n  that legally?\" he said.\\n      Asked if he would proceed with production controls without\\n  the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said \"You build a fragile\\n  house if you do it that way.\"\\n      Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers\\n  have expanded production, because high sugar price support\\n  means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such\\n  as soybeans and grain.\\n      But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would\\n  not be good policy.\\n      Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to\\n  sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they\\n  may be penalized retroactively under any production control\\n  legislation passed next year.\\n      Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in\\n  the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration\\n  proposal to drastically slash the program.\\n      \"The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don\\'t\\n  think it will get up a head of steam,\" Huckaby said.\\n      He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price\\n  support is unlikely to be approved.\\n      Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program,\\n  Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint\\n  with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the\\n  European Community\\'s sugar policy.

Certs can be used to\\n  repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or\\n  cash.\\n      Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion\\n  dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another\\n  6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and\\n  August 1987, according to USDA.\\n      Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily\\n  because recipients can use the certificates to pay back\\n  government loans at levels below the loan rate.\\n      Eliminating this practice, called \"PIK and roll,\" would save\\n  the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to\\n  the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according\\n  to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates\\n  cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.\\n      The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be\\n  considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other\\n  savings alternatives.\\n      The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the\\n  estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date\\n  have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln\\n  dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one\\n  administration official said.\\n      However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates\\n  based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.\\n      The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable\\n  to the different effect certificates can have on market prices\\n  over the course of a crop year.\\n      USDA\\'s Economic Research Service, for example, has found\\n  that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of\\n  corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by\\n  between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.\\n      Between September and November, however, certificates had\\n  only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS\\n  study, obtained by Reuters.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       " 'IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD\\n  The International Wheat Council (IWC)\\n  lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain\\n  production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared\\n  with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season.\\n      In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving\\n  unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming\\n  1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a\\n  record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in\\n  1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.\\n  The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to\\n  87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.\\n      The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and\\n  coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln\\n  against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln\\n  rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.\\n      The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is\\n  likely to be down from last year as low world prices and\\n  restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.\\n      At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a\\n  drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There\\n  is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the\\n  IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.\\n      Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain\\n  outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the\\n  European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is\\n  expected lower but oat sowings could rise.\\n      After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union\\n  plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln\\n  hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are\\n  likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved\\n  weather and a further increase in the use of intensive\\n  cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet\\n  maize output in 1987, the IWC said.\\n      Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be\\n  bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC\\n  said.\\n      It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at\\n  endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln\\n  tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.\\n      After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln\\n  tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of\\n  another large crop this coming season with higher output\\n  expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED\\n  Efforts by governments to control wheat\\n  surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial\\n  success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its\\n  latest monthly report.\\n      Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing\\n  both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC\\n  says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat\\n  exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.\\n      In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,\\n  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export\\n  income, there may be problems in reducing production.\\n      A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to\\n  unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.\\n  Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then\\n  lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.\\n      The IWC outlines three courses of action open to\\n  governments in wheat exporting countries.\\n      They could continue to support prices in the hope that when\\n  the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and\\n  surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.\\n      Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which\\n  could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long\\n  period.\\n      This option may prove to be the most politically\\n  unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning\\n  wheat production, the report said.\\n      The third option would be for governments to distinguish\\n  between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,\\n  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or\\n  overall production.\\n      The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting\\n  countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the\\n  producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.\\n      These changes did not always result in lower export\\n  subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more\\n  than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.\\n      For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention\\n  price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European\\n  currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which\\n  most export transactions are denominated, the intervention\\n  price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of\\n  supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers\\n  and some governments are now searching for ways to cut\\n  expenditure, the report says.\\n      The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five\\n  major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey\\n  from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to\\n  increased production in China and India.\\n      The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was\\n  countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower\\n  acreages.\\n      In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per\\n  cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to\\n  other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.\\n  Acreages are attributed to official incentives.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.\\n      The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company\\n  for the test case from among the 80 lodged \"because the bill\\n  (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the\\n  levy contained significant currency distortions and involved\\n  grain from a wide variety of origins.\" The name of the company\\n  is not being made public.\\n      The Administration Court is not expected to make a final\\n  ruling on the case in the near future.
