**_My name is Tribikram Thapa (Rana)._**
I have a background in Physiotherapy, and currently work as a Research Fellow at Monash University.

I aim to transition into finance with the hope of using blockchain technology in the banking sector. 

I chose FinTech as a course because it combines my passion in programming and finance.
